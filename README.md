# Full-Stack Developer Evaluation Project

Welcome to the Full-Stack Developer Evaluation Project! This repository contains a sample application that you'll be working with to demonstrate your full-stack development skills.

## Project Overview

The application consists of:
- Backend: Java Spring Boot application (Dockerized)
- Frontend: React Native application with Storybook components
- Basic UI and APIs are already implemented

Your task is to make specific modifications to showcase your understanding of various full-stack concepts and your ability to learn and implement new features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the existing codebase and architecture.
3. Set up the development environment as per the instructions in the `SETUP.md` file.

## Tasks

You are required to complete the following tasks:

1. **Backend Modification**
   - Add a new API endpoint with specific business logic (details in `TASKS.md`)
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Write unit tests for the new endpoint

2. **Frontend Enhancement**
   - Create a new React Native component and add it to the Storybook
   - Implement a new feature using existing components (details in `TASKS.md`)
   - Optimize component rendering performance

3. **API Integration**
   - Integrate the new backend API with the frontend
   - Implement proper state management (e.g., using Redux or Context API)
   - Handle API errors gracefully in the UI

4. **Docker Configuration**
   - Modify the Dockerfile to optimize the build process
   - Add a new environment variable to the Docker configuration

5. **Database Interaction**
   - Add a new database table or collection
   - Implement CRUD operations for the new data model

6. **New Feature Implementation**
   - Implement a feature using a library not present in the original codebase (details in `TASKS.md`)
   - Use the provided documentation links to research and implement the feature

## Submission Process

1. Create a new branch for your changes.
2. Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages.
3. Push your branch to the repository.
4. Create a pull request with a description of the changes you've made.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

| Criteria | Description | Weight |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Technical Proficiency | Correct implementation of required features, proper use of frameworks and tools | 30% |
| Code Quality | Readability, maintainability, error handling, use of design patterns | 25% |
| Problem-Solving Skills | Ability to debug and resolve issues, creative solutions | 15% |
| Learning Ability | Effectiveness in learning and implementing new concepts | 10% |
| Version Control | Proper use of Git, quality of pull request | 10% |
| Communication | Code comments, documentation, ability to explain decisions | 5% |
| Attention to Detail | Thoroughness in implementation, handling of edge cases | 5% |

## Time Limit

You have 3 hours to complete as many tasks as possible. Quality is valued over quantity, so focus on delivering well-implemented features rather than trying to complete everything if time is short.

## Questions and Support

If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the project, please open an issue in this repository. We're here to help!

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
